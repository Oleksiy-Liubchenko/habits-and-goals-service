# Goals and Habits tracker ![favicon-16x16.png](static%2Fimages%2Ffavicon-16x16.png)
> TODO killer ðŸ˜„

Every day is made up of tasks and habits. So why not control them to make life more efficient?

The project helps to set tasks and goals and monitor their implementation.
It is a Django-based project, that is visualised into a site. On this site, you can create goals, assign them sub-goals for detailing, filter by progress status, and track progress.

You can create a habit and the tracker will help you see the progress and how many days the habit has been completed.

Also, you can write comments for both goals and habits.
For convenience, a search by habit name and goal, respectively, has been added.
You can create, update and delete goals, sub-goals and habits.
